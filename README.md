# Replication of "Nowcasting Macroeconomic Variables with a Sparse Mixed Frequency Dynamic Factor Model"
A revised version of the code used for the simulation study in "Nowcasting Macroeconomic Variables with a Sparse Mixed Frequency Dynamic Factor Model" by Dr. [Karsten Schweikert](https://github.com/karstenschweikert) and I.

## Introduction

This repository contains the replication code for the following working paper:

Franjic, Domenic and Schweikert, Karsten, *Nowcasting Macroeconomic Variables with a Sparse Mixed Frequency Dynamic Factor Model* (February 21, 2024). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4733872 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4733872

The code simulates data from a dynamic factor model (DFM), explores various parameters such as sparsity levels and factor counts, and evaluates the performance using mean squared nowcasting error (MSNE). For detailed methodology and results, please refer to the [paper](https://ssrn.com/abstract=4733872).

## Features

- **Fast and Parallelised Cross-Validation**: Implements a parallelised random hyper-parameter search for efficient cross-validation.
- **Flexible Simulation Parameters**: Allows a high degree of customisation of the model parameterisation.
- **Compatibility**: Works on modern Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.
- **Open-Source**: Distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

## Prerequisites

- **Eigen** (version 3.4.0 or later): A C++ template library for linear algebra. [Eigen Website](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
- **OpenMP-compatible C++ Compiler**: Such as GCC (version 5.0 or later) or MSVC (Visual Studio 2019 or later).

## Installation

1. Make sure that a compatible version of Eigen3 (3.4.0 or later) is installed.
2. Install a OpenMP compatible C++ compiler such as GNU C++ Compiler or MSVC.
3. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ReplicationNowcastingMacroVarsWithSDFM.git
   cd ReplicationNowcastingMacroVarsWithSDFM
4. The repository is ready to compile. Using MinGW-w64 GCC with reasonable speed optimisation on windows, a potential compiler call could look something like this:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++14 -Wall -O3 -march=native -mfma -fopenmp -DNDEBUG -I "C:\Path\To\Eigen" ReplicationNowcastingMacroVarsWithSDFM.cpp Internals\*.cpp -o ReplicationNowcastingMacroVarsWithSDFM.exe
   ```
   On Linux or MAC, a possible compiler call might be
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++14 -Wall -O3 -march=native -mfma -fopenmp -DNDEBUG -I /path/to/eigen3 ReplicationNowcastingMacroVarsWithSDFM.cpp Internals/*.cpp -o ReplicationNowcastingMacroVarsWithSDFM
   ```
   Note that the speed optimisations are highly encouraged due to the computational complexity of the cross-validation scheme.

## Usage

Most of the model parameters are set at compile time. However, it is possible to pause the simulations and restart them at a later time. To re-parameterise the simulation study, it is generally sufficient to change the "hard" parameters at the beginning of ReplicationNowcastingMacroVarsWithSDFM.cpp. Further or more general changes to the model parameterisation require a reformulation of the structure in the data-generating part of ReplicationNowcastingMacroVarsWithSDFM.cpp or at deeper levels.
